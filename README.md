# Code-Quiz-MHD#

This is a homework project for Trilogy Full-Stack Bootcamp.

This is a quiz application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This application emphasizes the use of Javascript to provide quiz questions and collect user data to determine whether the answers to a question are correct, this then generates a score and appends a final page of results from the user data.

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

##  The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
